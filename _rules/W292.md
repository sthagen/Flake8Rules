Files should end with a newline.

### Anti-pattern

Imagine the example below is an entire file.

```python
import os

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
```
### Best practice

Imagine the example below is an entire file.

```python
import os

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
# This is a new line that ends the file.
```
