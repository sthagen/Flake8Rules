Indentation has both tabs and spaces in it. Programmers should use either tabs or spaces, but [not both](http://imgur.com/VyMu86F).

### Anti-pattern

**Note:** The `•` character represents a space and the `→` character represents a tab.

In this example, the third line contains four spaces and two tabs.

```python
def get_name(self):
    if self.first_name and self.last_name:
••••→ → return self.first_name + ' ' + self.last_name
    else:
        return self.last_name
```

### Best practice

Change the line to use spaces only.

```python
def get_name(self):
    if self.first_name and self.last_name:
••••••••return self.first_name + ' ' + self.last_name
    else:
        return self.last_name
```
